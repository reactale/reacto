<H2> Changing Language </H2>

With the help of config-reacto, we can change the output languages of all the reactos that comes after it.

Syntax: `((r.cfg.setLocale.LANGUAGE_CODE))`

The `LANGUAGE_CODE` is any valid language short codes that the particular browser supports. The full list of can be found at [reacto playground](/playground) under the dropdown named *Language Codes*.

**A Note on Browser Support**: Please note that list contains all the languages that will be supported by all the browsers, one day, maybe in future. In my current testing I have found that, surprisingly, * **Microsoft Edge** is supporting more languages than **Google Chrome** *.

<RTOCodeBlock>

```
# In English,((r.cfg.setLocale.en)) 
today is a ((r.dt.day)) of a ((r.dt.month))
and time is ((r.dt.hour24)):((r.dt.min)):((r.dt.sec))

# In Bengali,((r.cfg.setLocale.bn)) 
today is a ((r.dt.day)) of a ((r.dt.month))
and time is ((r.dt.hour24)):((r.dt.min)):((r.dt.sec))

# In Gujrati,((r.cfg.setLocale.gu))
today is a ((r.dt.day)) of a ((r.dt.month))
and time is ((r.dt.hour24)):((r.dt.min)):((r.dt.sec))

# In Hindi,((r.cfg.setLocale.hi)) 
today is a ((r.dt.day)) of a ((r.dt.month))
and time is ((r.dt.hour24)):((r.dt.min)):((r.dt.sec))

# In Marathi,((r.cfg.setLocale.mr))
today is a ((r.dt.day)) of a ((r.dt.month))
and time is ((r.dt.hour24)):((r.dt.min)):((r.dt.sec))

# Set things back to English
# Or else, next reacto will get affected
((r.cfg.setLocale.en)) 
```

<H2> Switching Reacto Printing OFF </H2>

If we want to do some work (e.g. doing calculations) with reacto(s) but don't want their values to be printed on screen, we can use this reacto. It will print blank for all the reactos that come after it.

Syntax: `((r.cfg.printOff))`

<RTOCodeBlock>

```
# Before Turning Print OFF
4 + 5 = ((r.calc. 4 + 5))   // Will show "4 + 5 = 9"

# After Turning Print OFF
((r.cfg.printOff))\
4 + 5 = ((r.calc. 4 + 5))   // Will only show "4 + 5 ="
```

</RTOCodeBlock>


<H2> Switching Reacto Printing ON </H2>

This s opposite of `((r.cfg.printOff))`, when we want to turn printing back on

Syntax: `((r.cfg.printOn))`

<RTOCodeBlock>

```
# Turning Print OFF
((r.cfg.printOff))\
10 + 8 = ((r.calc. 10 + 8))   // Will show "10 + 8"

# Turning Print ON
((r.cfg.printOff))\
10 + 8 = ((r.calc. 10 + 8))   // Will show "10 + 8 = 18"
```

</RTOCodeBlock>
