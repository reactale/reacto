# Config Reacto ((r.cfg.))

Config reacto helps change the configuration of the reactos that comes after it


## Changing Language

With the help of config-reacto, we can change the output languages of all the reactos that comes after it.

Syntax: `((r.cfg.setLocale.LANGUAGE_CODE))`

The `LANGUAGE_CODE` is any valid language short codes that the particular browser supports. The full list of can be found at [reacto playground](/playground) under the dropdown named *Language Codes*.

**A Note on Browser Support**: Please note that list contains all the languages that will be supported by all the browsers, one day, maybe in future. In my current testing I have found that, surprisingly, * **Microsoft Edge** is supporting more languages than **Google Chrome** *.
