# Variable Reacto `((r.var.))`

The purpose of variable reactos are to store data which can later be retrieved used for display, calculation etc.

## A. Set Data and Get Data 

We can store any kind of data/value in a variable reacto. 

The format to store the data is `((r.var.keyName = any number or text value here))`

Here **keyName** can be any text, without a space i.e. it should be a single word.

And to retrieve the same data, we just need to give the correct keyName whose data we want to get, `((r.var.keyName))`


<RTOCodeBlock>

```
# Storing Data
((r.var.favColor = Blue))\
((r.var.favNumber = 9))\
((r.var.aLongText = Reactos Are COOOL!!))\

# Getting Data Back\
My Favourite Color: ((r.var.favColor))
My Lucky Number: ((r.var.favNumber))
I think: ((r.var.aLongText))
```
