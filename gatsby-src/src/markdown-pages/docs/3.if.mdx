# Conditional Reacto `((r.if.))`

Conditional reacto (if-reacto) helps us do something based on a condition


## A. The Structure and The Operators

### A.1. The Structure
The structure of if-reacto is a but different than other reactos. Inside the reacto body itself it will have the condition i.e. `((r.if. some_condition ))` and then after the reacto, inside double curly braces we will have the thing that we want it to perform.

So, the structure is,
```
((r.if. some_condition)) {{ 
    if_the_condition_is_true
    then_come_here
 }}
```

The condition to be checked will have a structure of `operand operator operand`, the `operands` can be any number or text or any reacto that resolves to a number or text.

### A.2. The Operators
The available conditional / logical operators are,
- Equal `=`
- Not Equal `!=`
- Greater Than `>`
- Greater Than Or Equal `>=`
- Less Than `<`
- Less Than Or Equal `<=`

## B. Usages and Exmaples

### B.1. Check If Equal `=`

If 2 things are equal, then do something.

#### Examples

<RTOCodeBlock>

```
# Equality Check

# Direct Number Check
((r.if. 5 = 5)) {{ Yes, obviously they are equal }}
((r.if. 5 = 6)) {{ This line will NOT get printed }}\

# Direct Text Check
((r.if. Sky is blue = Sky is blue)) {{ Yeah, yeah, the sky is blue ... }}
((r.if. Sky is blue = Sky is red)) {{ Nope, false, hence no print for this one ... }}\

# One operand a reacto
((r.if. r.dt.year = 2021)) {{ This text will be printed only if the current year matches }}
((r.if. r.dt.day = Friday)) {{ If current day matches, show this text }}

# Both operand reactos
((r.var.myFavColor = Blue))\
((r.var.yourFavColor = Orange))\
((r.var.guessMonth = May))\
((r.if. r.var.myFavColor = r.var.yourFavColor)) {{ We both love ((r.var.myFavColor)) }}
((r.if. r.var.guessMonth = r.dt.month)) {{ This text will be printed only if current month is what we guessed }}
```

</RTOCodeBlock>


### B.2. Check If NOT Equal `!=`

If 2 things are NOT equal, then do something.

#### Examples

<RTOCodeBlock>

```
# Equality Check

# Direct Number Check
((r.if. 5 != 5)) {{ False, no print }}\
((r.if. 5 != 6)) {{ True, 5 is not equal to 6 }}

# Direct Text Check
((r.if. Sky is blue != Sky is blue)) {{ False, as they are equal }}\
((r.if. Sky is blue != Sky is red)) {{ True, two texts are not the same }}

# One operand a reacto
((r.if. r.dt.year != 2018)) {{ This will show only if the current year is not 2018 }}\
((r.if. r.dt.day != Friday)) {{ If current day does not match, show this text }}

# Both operand reactos
((r.var.myFavColor = Blue))\
((r.var.yourFavColor = Orange))\
((r.var.guessMonth = May))\
((r.if. r.var.myFavColor != r.var.yourFavColor)) {{ True, our favourite colors are different }}
((r.if. r.var.guessMonth != r.dt.month)) {{ True, if we guessed wrong month }}
```
