We can have 1 level interpolation / nesting of var inside another var.
These inner vars are interpreted in real time 
that means, if we change them elsewhere, those changes will be reflected when we read the parent var

Use the Outer var as template to hold the inner vars which can be changed later as needed

((r.var.text =
    The real identity of r.var.hero is r.var.name
))\

Example 1
----------
((r.var.hero = Superman))\
((r.var.name = Clark Kent))\
((r.var.text))

Example 2
----------
((r.var.hero = Spiderman))\
((r.var.name = Peter Parker))\
((r.var.text))
